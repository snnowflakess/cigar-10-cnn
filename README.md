#  CNN Image Classifier – CIFAR-10 Dataset

##  Project Overview

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow and Keras** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset** into 10 categories such as airplanes, cars, birds, and more.
It demonstrates how deep learning models can automatically learn visual patterns and features from raw image data.

##  Key Steps

* Loaded and preprocessed the CIFAR-10 dataset.
* Built a multi-layer CNN architecture using `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `Flatten`, and `Dense` layers.
* Trained and validated the model with accuracy tracking across epochs.
* Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix and accuracy metrics.
* Visualized training results and sample predictions.

##  Learning Outcomes

* Gained hands-on experience with **TensorFlow/Keras CNNs**.
* Understood how convolution and pooling extract image features.
* Learned the end-to-end process of image classification in deep learning.
* Improved understanding of hyperparameters and model tuning.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **TensorFlow / Keras**
* **Matplotlib**
* **NumPy**

## Results

Achieved around **70–80% accuracy** on the CIFAR-10 test dataset after several training epochs.
Accuracy can be improved by adjusting network depth, optimizer, or using data augmentation.
